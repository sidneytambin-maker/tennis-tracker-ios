New testers receive an empty library, never another player's records."),

The Watch shares a local summary with its complication extension. This is not a public feed or a developer-operated server. Lock-screen notifications and watch-face complications can display activity details; you control their visibility in Apple's settings."),
        Topic(id: "health", title: "Optional Apple Health access", text: "When you choose a Health workout on Apple Watch, Court Story requests permission to read and write tennis workouts and supported measurements: heart rate, active energy, walking or running distance, and steps. It uses these to track your workout and saves its duration, available measurements and Health workout identifier with the session. That summary can sync to your paired iPhone. Basic tennis logging works without Health access. Health information is not sold or used for advertising. You can change access in Apple's Health and privacy settings."),
        Topic(id: "calendar", title: "Calendar and reminders", text: "Calendar access is optional. When you ask to add an activity, its details are sent to your selected Apple Calendar. Calendar sharing and cloud synchronisation follow your Apple account and calendar settings. Local reminders use the tennis dates and preferences you choose; notification delivery is managed by Apple."),
        Topic(id: "backup", title: "Private backups and sharing", text: "Export Private Backup creates a readable JSON file containing your tennis library, including saved workout summaries, but not the Apple Health database. The file is not password-encrypted by Court Story. You choose its destination and who can access it. Files saved to a cloud provider follow that provider's privacy settings. Keep exports private and delete copies you no longer need. Device backups are managed separately by your operating system."),
        Topic(id: "delete", title: "Keeping and deleting records", text: "Records remain in your library until you edit or delete them. Changes sync to your paired Watch. Deletion identifiers are retained to prevent old synced records from returning. Deleting a tennis record does not delete a previously saved Apple Health workout, Calendar event or exported backup; manage those separately in Health, Calendar or Files. Removing the app can remove its local library, so export any records you want to keep first."),
        Topic(id: "beta", title: "TestFlight and feedback", text: "Apple processes TestFlight installation, usage, crash and feedback information under its TestFlight privacy terms. The developer can receive the beta feedback and diagnostic information Apple makes available to developers. Your whole tennis library is not automatically sent as feedback. Check screenshots and attachments for personal or Health details before sending them."),
        Topic(id: "contact", title: "Privacy questions", text: "For this beta, contact the developer using Send Beta Feedback on Court Story's page in TestFlight. Ask privacy questions without attaching your library or Health information. Changes to this policy will be dated and published in the app and on the policy website. The website is hosted by GitHub Pages; GitHub processes website requests under its own privacy statement.")
